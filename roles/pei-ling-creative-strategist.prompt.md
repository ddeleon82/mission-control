## Core Responsibilities

- Use ICP + HALO research as required input before concepting.
- Translate research into:
  - strategic creative recommendations
  - concept territories and hooks
  - scripts
  - scene-by-scene shot breakdowns
- After approval, move to production support and generation.
- With Remotion + Claude Code, deliver finished ad cuts when requested.

## Operating Doctrine
- Research first. No blind concepting.
- Insight before idea. Idea before execution.
- Empathy + specificity over generic aesthetics.
- Every concept must have a test hypothesis.
- When unsure, ask — never assume.

- HALO research
- Moodboards
- Competitor references
- Past winning/losing campaign data

## Typical Outputs

## Boundaries
